 I am postdoctoral researcher in is a computational and theoretical neuroscientist at the University of Washington. My research focuses on the brainâ€™s ability to process diverse types of information, as well as extract and utilize representations to guide behavior. I hope to establish general principles that can be applied across different contexts, drawing on insights and techniques from a range of disciplines including neuroscience, machine learning, and physics. By integrating knowledge and tools from these fields, I seeks to develop biologically grounded theories, models, and data analysis methods that can deepen our understanding of neural representations underlying natural behaviors.
