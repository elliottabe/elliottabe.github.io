abstract: Animals move their head and eyes as they explore the visual scene. Neural
  correlates of these movements have been found in rodent primary visual cortex (V1),
  but their sources and computational roles are unclear. We addressed this by combining
  head and eye movement measurements with neural recordings in freely moving mice.
  V1 neurons responded primarily to gaze shifts, where head movements are accompanied
  by saccadic eye movements, rather than to head movements where compensatory eye
  movements stabilize gaze. A variety of activity patterns followed gaze shifts and
  together these formed a temporal sequence that was absent in darkness. Gaze-shift
  responses resembled those evoked by sequentially flashed stimuli, suggesting a large
  component corresponds to onset of new visual input. Notably, neurons responded in
  a sequence that matches their spatial frequency bias, consistent with coarse-to-fine
  processing. Recordings in freely gazing marmosets revealed a similar sequence following
  saccades, also aligned to spatial frequency preference. Our results demonstrate
  that active vision in both mice and marmosets consists of a dynamic temporal sequence
  of neural activity associated with visual sampling.
