abstract: Many studies of visual processing are conducted in constrained conditions
  such as head- and gaze-fixation, and therefore less is known about how animals actively
  acquire visual information in natural contexts. To determine how mice target their
  gaze during natural behavior, we measured head and bilateral eye movements in mice
  performing prey capture, an ethological behavior that engages vision. We found that
  the majority of eye movements are compensatory for head movements, thereby serving
  to stabilize the visual scene. During movement, however, periods of stabilization
  are interspersed with non-compensatory saccades that abruptly shift gaze position.
  Notably, these saccades do not preferentially target the prey location. Rather,
  orienting movements are driven by the head, with the eyes following in coordination
  to sequentially stabilize and recenter the gaze. These findings relate eye movements
  in the mouse to other species, and provide a foundation for studying active vision
  during ethological behaviors in the mouse.
