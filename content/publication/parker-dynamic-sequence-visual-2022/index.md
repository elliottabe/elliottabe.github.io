abstract: Animals move their head and eyes as they explore and sample the visual scene.
  Previous studies have demonstrated neural correlates of head and eye movements in
  rodent primary visual cortex (V1), but the sources and computational roles of these
  signals are unclear. We addressed this by combining measurement of head and eye
  movements with high density neural recordings in freely moving mice. V1 neurons
  responded primarily to gaze shifts, where head movements are accompanied by saccadic
  eye movements, but not to head movements where compensatory eye movements stabilize
  gaze. A variety of activity patterns immediately followed gaze shifts, including
  units with positive, biphasic, or negative responses, and together these responses
  formed a temporal sequence following the gaze shift. These responses were greatly
  diminished in the dark for the vast majority of units, replaced by a uniform suppression
  of activity, and were similar to those evoked by sequentially flashed stimuli in
  head-fixed conditions, suggesting that gaze shift transients represent the temporal
  response to the rapid onset of new visual input. Notably, neurons responded in a
  sequence that matches their spatial frequency preference, from low to high spatial
  frequency tuning, consistent with coarse-to-fine processing of the visual scene
  following each gaze shift. Recordings in foveal V1 of freely gazing head-fixed marmosets
  revealed a similar sequence of temporal response following a saccade, as well as
  the progression of spatial frequency tuning. Together, our results demonstrate that
  active vision in both mice and marmosets consists of a dynamic temporal sequence
  of neural activity associated with visual sampling.HighlightsDuring free movement,
  neurons in mouse V1 respond to head movements that are accompanied by a gaze-shifting
  saccadic eye movement, but not a compensatory eye movement.Neurons respond to gaze
  shifts with diverse temporal dynamics that form a sequence across the population,
  from early positive responses to biphasic and negative responses.In darkness, most
  neurons show a uniform suppression following a gaze shift.Temporal dynamics of responses
  correspond to a neuron's temporal and spatial frequency preferences, consistent
  with a coarse-to-fine processing sequence.A similar temporal sequence following
  saccades is observed in foveal V1 of freely gazing head-fixed marmosets, demonstrating
  shared aspects of active visual processing across species.Competing Interest StatementThe
  authors have declared no competing interest.
