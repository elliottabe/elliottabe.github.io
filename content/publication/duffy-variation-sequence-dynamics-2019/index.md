abstract: Significance             In this work, we show a way by which the nervous
  system maintains precise, stereotyped behavior in the face of environmental and
  neural changes. Through a model of bird song learning, we show how instability in
  neural representation of stable behavior can allow a system to more readily adapt
  and maintain performance with minimal cost. In this perspective, behaviors are made
  more robust to environmental change by continually seeking subtly new ways of performing
  the same task. Thus, one should expect to find variability in neural systems executing
  stereotyped behaviors, and this variability can serve a constructive role in maintaining
  skilled behavior.           ,              Performing a stereotyped behavior successfully
  over time requires both maintaining performance quality and adapting efficiently
  to environmental or physical changes affecting performance. The bird song system
  is a paradigmatic example of learning a stereotyped behavior and therefore is a
  good place to study the interaction of these two goals. Through a model of bird
  song learning, we show how instability in neural representation of stable behavior
  confers advantages for adaptation and maintenance with minimal cost to performance
  quality. A precise, temporally sparse sequence from the premotor nucleus HVC is
  crucial to the performance of song in songbirds. We find that learning in the presence
  of sequence variations facilitates rapid relearning after shifts in the target song
  or muscle structure and results in decreased error with neuron loss. This robustness
  is due to the prevention of the buildup of correlations in the learned connectivity.
  In the absence of sequence variations, these correlations grow, due to the relatively
  low dimensionality of the exploratory variation in comparison with the number of
  plastic synapses. Our results suggest one would expect to see variability in neural
  systems executing stereotyped behaviors, and this variability is an advantageous
  feature rather than a challenge to overcome.
