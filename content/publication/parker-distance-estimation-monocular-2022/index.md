abstract: In natural contexts, sensory processing and motor output are closely coupled,
  which is reflected in the fact that many brain areas contain both sensory and movement
  signals. However, standard reductionist paradigms decouple sensory decisions from
  their natural motor consequences, and head-­fixation prevents the natural sensory
  consequences of self-m­ otion. In particular, movement through the environment provides
  a number of depth cues beyond stereo vision that are poorly understood. To study
  the integration of visual processing and motor output in a naturalistic task, we
  investigated distance estimation in freely moving mice. We found that mice use vision
  to accurately jump across a variable gap, thus directly coupling a visual computation
  to its corresponding ethological motor output. Monocular eyelid suture did not affect
  gap jumping success, thus mice can use cues that do not depend on binocular disparity
  and stereo vision. Under monocular conditions, mice altered their head positioning
  and performed more vertical head movements, consistent with a shift from using stereopsis
  to other monocular cues, such as motion or position parallax. Finally, optogenetic
  suppression of primary visual cortex impaired task performance under both binocular
  and monocular conditions when optical fiber placement was localized to binocular
  or monocular zone V1, respectively. Together, these results show that mice can use
  monocular cues, relying on visual cortex, to accurately judge distance. Furthermore,
  this behavioral paradigm provides a foundation for studying how neural circuits
  convert sensory information into ethological motor output.
